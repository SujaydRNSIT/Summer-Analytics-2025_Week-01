# 📊 Summer Analytics 2025 – Week 1 Submission 🚀

A Journey into Data Science with **IIT Guwahati’s Consulting & Analytics Club** 🌟

Welcome to my **Week 1 submission repository for Summer Analytics 2025, a free, 5-week online course by the Consulting & Analytics Club (C&A), IIT Guwahati!** 🎓 

This repository contains my solutions for the first assignment and reflects my initial steps into the exciting world of data science and machine learning. Let’s dive into the details! 📊💻

# About Summer Analytics 2025 🌍

Organized by **the Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati, Summer Analytics 2025** is a transformative program designed to kickstart your journey into data science and machine learning. With a community of 25,000+ learners annually and a modern, industry-relevant curriculum, this course is where learning meets the future of the industry! 🚀

- **Duration:** 5 weeks
- **Mode:** Online
- **Focus:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, and introductory Data Analysis skills
- **Week 1:** Assignment + Graded Quiz on Data Analysis 📝

I’m thrilled to be part of this journey, and this repository showcases my Week 1 efforts! 

Let’s explore what’s inside. 🧑‍💻
# Repository Structure 🗂️

Here’s what you’ll find in this repository:

- `SA2025_W1.ipynb`: My Jupyter Notebook containing the solutions to the Week 1 assignment. This includes all the tasks and quiz-related computations 📓
- `Cars.csv`: The dataset provided for the assignment, containing 398 rows and 9 columns about cars (`mpg`, `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, `weight`, `acceleration`, `model_year`, `origin`, `name`). 🚗
- `README.md`: You’re reading it!📄

# Assignment Overview 📚

The Week 1 assignment focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the `Cars.csv` dataset. It tests foundational skills in Python, Pandas, and NumPy, along with problem-solving through data manipulation and analysis.

# How to Explore This Repository 🔎

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/summer-analytics-2025-week1.git
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Week1_Assignment.ipynb`.

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Ensure Dependencies:** Make sure you have the required libraries installed

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. **Run the Code:** Execute the cells in the notebook to see my solutions in action! The `Cars.csv` dataset should be in the same directory as the notebook. 🖥️

# Challenges and Learnings 🧠

This assignment was a fantastic learning experience! Here are some highlights:

- **Handling Missing Data:** Dealt with 6 missing `horsepower` values using `pd.to_numeric(df['horsepower'], errors='coerce')`. 🛠️
- **Data Manipulation:** Mastered Pandas operations like `set_index`, `unique`, and filtering (e.g., `df[df['mpg'] >= 35]`). 🐼
- **Debugging Discrepancies:** Resolved Q2 and Q mismatches by verifying the dataset and correcting filter conditions. 🕵️
- **EDA Skills:** Gained confidence in exploratory data analysis, from summarizing data to visualizing trends (e.g., scatterplots in earlier tasks). 📉

The process taught me the importance of precision in coding and the value of double-checking results, key skills for any data scientist! 💡

# Why This Submission Matters 🌟

This repository is more than just an assignment, It’s the first step in my data science journey with Summer Analytics 2025. By completing these tasks, I’ve laid the foundation for mastering data science and machine learning, aligning with C&A’s mission to provide high-quality, accessible education to a global community. 🌍

I’m excited to continue this **5-week adventure**, building on these skills to tackle more complex problems in the weeks ahead! 🚀
